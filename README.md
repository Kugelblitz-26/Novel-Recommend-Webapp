## Features

- **Recommendation Engine**: A content-based recommendation engine that suggests novels based on user preferences.
- **Flask Web App**: A user-friendly web interface to interact with the recommendation system.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different novel datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and vectorize novel data to enable recommendation calculations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git@github.com:Kugelblitz-26/Novel-Recommend-Website.git
   cd novel-recommendation-flask
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your novel dataset in CSV format. Ensure that it includes columns for novel titles, descriptions, genres, and tags.

2. Run the Flask web application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the Novel Recommendation System by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Model Creation

1. Prepare your novel dataset by cleaning and preprocessing the data.

2. Create a TF-IDF vectorizer for text data.

3. Compute cosine similarity between novel vectors to identify similar novels.

4. Use the recommendation model to generate recommendations for each novel.

5. Serialize the recommendation model (e.g., using `pickle`) and save it as a `.pkl` file for easy retrieval in the Flask application.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting service that supports Python web applications.

Ensure to set up any environment variables required for secure deployment.
